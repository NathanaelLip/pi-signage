# Pi-Signage

Pi-Signage is a web applcation designed to host simple one page slideshows on my Raspberry Pi's but could be used on any device connected to a display.

Thanks to the fact it is all web based, this allows for smooth transitions, video playback (with animations), simple file handling, and is incredibly light on the system.

# Requirements

1. Any device with any operating system (Tested on rasbian lite)*
2. Device must connect to the internet
3. Nginx installed
4. PHP 8+
5. Chromium browser


[*] I recomend setting up a command line only device, as its better for system performance.

# [Install](https://github.com/NathanaelLip/pi-signage/blob/main/install.md)

# Todo:
    Add Animated flyouts for upload info
    Create Preview Page to edit/change the transition
    Add instructions to disabled .html with nginx
